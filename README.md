Get more control of your sound effects to make your game feel more satisfying. This plugin allows you to input hex values for a wider range of sound effects with a single event than the normal Play Sound event will let you. The plugin includes Game Boy Sound Manipulator (Version 1.01) which will assist you in creating and testing sounds, and then give you the corresponding hex code values for the plugin.
